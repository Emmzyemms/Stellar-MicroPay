### Notable shipped functionality

- Payment streams: contract entry points include `open_stream`, `claim_stream`, `top_up_stream`, `close_stream`, `pause_stream`, and `resume_stream` in [contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs](contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs).
- Tips: sender-authorized tip flows and payer receipt tracking are implemented in [contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs](contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs), while public app and API support live in [frontend/pages/tip/[username].tsx](frontend/pages/tip/[username].tsx) and [backend/src/routes/tips.js](backend/src/routes/tips.js).
- Scheduled payments: recurring DCA-style flows are surfaced in [frontend/pages/scheduled-payments.tsx](frontend/pages/scheduled-payments.tsx) and backed by Turrets helpers.
- Multi-sig: the wallet workflow exists as a first-class UI in [frontend/components/MultiSigFlow.tsx](frontend/components/MultiSigFlow.tsx).

## 🔄 In progress / open gaps

These items are not complete or are still missing production-grade persistence.

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Persistent storage for app data | In progress | The backend tip service currently stores creator tip data in memory rather than durable storage; this is a real gap for production resilience. See [backend/src/services/tipsService.js](backend/src/services/tipsService.js). |
| Production-ready backup / recovery for on-chain and app state | In progress | Needs durable persistence, export, and restore flows for creator data, scheduled jobs, and event state. |
| Full batch payment v2.0 implementation | In progress | [contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs](contracts/stellar-micropay-contract/src/lib.rs) still contains the placeholder `batch_send` stub; the real implementation is not yet shipped. |
| Cross-chain / multi-currency support | In progress | Multi-currency and asset conversion work is still deferred relative to the current codebase. |

> The project is no longer “v1.0 only” or “future state only”; the repo already contains the shipped features above, and the remaining work is mostly durability, polish, and the unimplemented batch-payment follow-up.

## 🚧 Not started

| Feature | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Username registry / human-readable handle mapping | Not started | No username resolver or wallet mapping is implemented in the repo yet. |
| QR code payment generation / deep links | Not started | No wallet QR flow or deep-linking feature exists in the app yet. |
| Payment request links | Not started | No shareable payment-request generator is wired as a first-class flow. |
| Advanced analytics export | Not started | No CSV export or richer analytics dashboard is shipped. |
| Native USDC / multi-asset conversion flow | Not started | Not yet implemented in the current codebase. |
| Full persistent backend for all live workflow state | Not started | Durable storage for tips, scheduled jobs, and similar live data is still a gap. |
